    <h2 class="citta">Europe</h2>

    <p class="choose2">Europe has lost the plot. As we approach the 50th anniversary of the treaty of Rome on 25th March
        2007—the 50th birthday of the European economic community that became the European Union—Europe no longer knows
        what story it wants to tell. A shared political narrative sustained the postwar project of (west) European
        integration for three generations, but it has fallen apart since the end of the cold war. Most Europeans now
        have little idea where we’re coming from; far less do we share a vision of where we want to go to. We don’t know
        why we have an EU or what it’s good for. So we urgently need a new narrative.</p>

    <a name="America"></a>
    <h2 class="citta">America</h2>

    <p class="choose2">Native Americans lived in the Americas for thousands of years. English people in 1607 went to the
        place now called Jamestown, Virginia. Other European settlers went to the colonies, mostly from England and
        later Great Britain. France, Spain, and the Netherlands also colonized North America. In 1775, a war between the
        thirteen colonies and Britain began when the colonists were upset over paying taxation to their government in
        the UK, but were not being given any chance to vote in the UK/British elections, to contribute to how that money
        was spent.In 1776, in Philadelphia, the Second Continental Congress declared the independence of the colonies as
        the "United States". Led by General George Washington, it won the Revolutionary War. The peace treaty of 1783
        established the borders of the new nation. The Articles of Confederation established a central government, but
        it was ineffectual at providing stability as it could not collect taxes and had no executive officer. A
        convention wrote a new Constitution that was adopted in 1789 and a Bill of Rights was added in 1791 to guarantee
        inalienable rights.</p>

    <a name="SudAmerica"></a>
    <h2 class="citta">Sud America</h2>

    <p class="choose2">The history of South America is the study of the past, particularly the written record, oral
        histories, and traditions, passed down from generation to generation on the continent of South America. The
        continent continues to be home to indigenous peoples, some of whom built high civilizations prior to the arrival
        of Europeans in the late 1400s and early 1500s. South America has a history that has a wide range of human
        cultures and forms of civilization. The Norte Chico civilization in Peru is the oldest civilization in the
        Americas and one of the first six independent civilizations in the world; it was contemporaneous with the
        Egyptian pyramids. It predated the Mesoamerican Olmec by nearly two millennia.</p>

    <a name="Asia"></a>
    <h2 class="citta">Asia</h2>
    <p class="choose2">Asia, the world’s largest and most diverse continent. It occupies the eastern four-fifths of the
        giant Eurasian landmass. Asia is more a geographic term than a homogeneous continent, and the use of the term to
        describe such a vast area always carries the potential of obscuring the enormous diversity among the regions it
        encompasses. Asia has both the highest and the lowest points on the surface of Earth, has the longest coastline
        of any continent, is subject overall to the world’s widest climatic extremes, and, consequently, produces the
        most varied forms of vegetation and animal life on Earth. In addition, the peoples of Asia have established the
        broadest variety of human adaptation found on any of the continents.</p>
