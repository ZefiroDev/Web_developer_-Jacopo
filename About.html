      Christopher McCandless had the courage the explore the undiscovered and is remembered even today because he stood
      for what he believed in while many often settle for the life which guarantees safety and security. In many
      instances what makes his life more meaningful is his experience which is in the current world inaccessible to most
      people, given that our environments have changed so much and we have been drawn away from nature. </p>
